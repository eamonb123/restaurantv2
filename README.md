 ###How to run
  You can simply run the code by clicking the green arrow. 
  
  
 ###Problems
+If you create a customer before your create a waiter, that customer is forever lost. You must first create 
a waiter and then create a customer for them to interact. 
+ There are no image icons on the waiters and customers. I did not know how to have the strings follow them
and stay directly on top of them the entire time
+ There is a potential semaphore issue that runs in an infinite loop when all the customers leave and all the tables are empty
